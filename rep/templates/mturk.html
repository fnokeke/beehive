        Goal
      </h3>
      <p>
        The goal of this experiment is to test an app that measures Facebook usage. This experiment does not
        store any of your data.
        <br>
        If you don't already have Facebook app on your android phone then you may skip the experiment
        entirely as this experiment targets users with Facebook already installed.

            Please note that while this research covers multiple devices, some android phones may not generate a
            code because of compatibility issues. Unfortunately, this is out of our control due to different
            softwares from multiple android vendors.
